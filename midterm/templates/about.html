            <p>The 1975 are an English pop rock band formed in 2002 in Wilmslow, Cheshire.Now based in Manchester,the band consists of lead vocalist, producer, lyricist and rhythm guitarist Matty Healy,lead guitarist Adam Hann, bassist Ross MacDonald, and drummer/producer George Daniel.

                The band's origins trace to their attendance at secondary school and playing together as teenagers. Gigs, organized by a council worker, led the band to sign with Dirty Hit and Polydor Records. The band opened for several major acts and released a series of extended plays (Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars, IV) throughout 2012 before releasing their self-titled debut album (2013), which included the popular singles "Sex", "Chocolate", and "Robbers" and reached number one in the United Kingdom.
                
                The 1975 has garnered acclaim for their exploration of an eclectic range of genres such as pop rock, synth-pop, R&B, electropop, new wave forms of electronic music (such as UK garage, 2-step and ambient),  and forms of rock music (such as shoegaze, post-punk and post-rock), as well as elements of jazz, soul and gospel.</p>
